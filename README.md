### Hi there and welcome 👋 :octocat:

I am a Psychologist/ Neuroscientist 🧠 by training loving to get my hands busy with coding 💻 and to gain new data-driven insights 💡. Excited about cognition, (mental) health topics and how to tackle the climate crisis! 🌳 </br>
🌱 Honed my coding and other technical and non-technical skills with [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/) in the data part-time bootcamp.</br></br>
So far there is not so much to see here, but this github presence is not done, so tune in from time to time! ⌚</br>
</br>
**What you can find here** </br>
🎮 Fancy a game of [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/pcfisch/tic-tac-toe)? Grab a player and have fun! </br>
🏘️ Exploratory Data Analysis [practice on housing](https://github.com/pcfisch/eda-project-nf) </br>
⏳ Currently working on a machine learning project...
